# CS50-Finance

This project was a task project from the curriculum of CS50 web-track. The goal of this project was to display multiple pages simulating a trade website where the user can "buy" and "sell" stocks by querying IEX for stock prices.

The task was to create all the templates for the pages to be displayed and implement: register, quote, buy, index, sell and history function in application.py. All users data were saved in a database using sqlite.
